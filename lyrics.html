			Every night in my dreams
			I see you, I feel you
			That is how I know you go on
			Far across the distance
			And spaces between us
			You have come to show you go on
			
			Near, far, wherever you are
			I believe that the heart does go on
			Once more, you open the door
			And you're here in my heart
			And my heart will go on and on
			Love can touch us one time
			And last for a lifetime
			And never let go 'til we're gone
			Love was when I loved you
			One true time I'd hold to
			In my life, we'll always go on
			
			Near, far, wherever you are
			I believe that the heart does go on (why does the heart go on?)
			Once more, you open the door
			And you're here in my heart
			And my heart will go on and on
			You're here, there's nothing I fear
			And I know that my heart will go on
			We'll stay forever this way
			You are safe in my heart and
			My heart will go on and on
